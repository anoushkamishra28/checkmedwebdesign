                            <p> Checkmed is a digital portal that aims to connect pathological services across the country at 
                                a single place. This initiative solves many problems. Firstly, it allows end-users to connect 
                                to doctors and labs, which they wouldâ€™ve otherwise been unaware of and might also gain 
                                access to their services. Second, it enables people from underdeveloped areas to gain 
                                insight into the market and hence possibly gain cost-effective services. Pathology labs can 
                                also connect to jointly work on a common project/case using the platform and ultimately 
                                help science for good.

                                account on our platform once, where all of your reports, bookings, and such information 
                                shall be stored. If you require a particular diagnostic test regularly, then it is sane to access it from the account history and book it the same way as you did in the past one. Efficient

                                Checkmedâ€™s infrastructure is designed to be paperless. We are playing our part for the 
betterment of the environment, and you can contribute too. Once you book an 
appointment, the details are accessible from your mobile app, which can be used as proof if 
you visit/book a service. No need to go to a cafÃ© to get it printed! The payment proof is also 
delivered to your mobile number via SMS. The reports are also available digitally so you 
can reduce the dependence on paper.
